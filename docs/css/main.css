  This the main stylesheet for the application.

  We use the @import rule to include other stylesheets.
  This allows us to modularize our CSS and keep it organized.

  Note that the browser will load these stylesheets in the order
  they are imported. It will not load them in parallel, unlike
  <link rel="stylesheet"> tags in the HTML which will be loaded in
  parallel.
